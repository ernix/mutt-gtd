Little mutt hack to toggle gtd tags via the custom email header field X-Label 

After reading [1] (via @felixge) I started using [2] but dislike the amount of required keystrokes to actually to the tagging of single emails.

Wouldn't it be easier to simple toggle a fixed set of tags?

Here is the result.
